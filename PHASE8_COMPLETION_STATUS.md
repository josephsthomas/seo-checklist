## Known Limitations

### Not Included in Phase 8 (Future Phases):
- **Functionality enhancements** - File attachments, time tracking, timeline fields (Phase 9+)
- **Client portal** - Read-only client view (Phase 9)
- **Budget tracking** - Cost vs estimate tracking (Phase 9)
- **Advanced filtering** - Saved filter presets (Phase 9)
- **Gantt chart timeline** - Visual timeline view (Phase 10+)
- **Email notifications** - Alert system (Phase 10+)
- **API access** - Integration endpoints (Phase 10+)

### Rationale:
Phase 8 focused exclusively on **content additions** (checklist items + help) to address SEO gaps identified in executive review. Functionality enhancements are more complex, require longer development cycles, and should be implemented in separate, focused phases with testing between features.

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### Option 1: Revert to Pre-Phase 8 State
```bash
# Find last commit before Phase 8
git log --oneline | grep "Phase 7"

# Revert to that commit
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git push -f origin claude/implement-prompts-011CUR7J52K6jdU6LdUoT2ve
```

### Option 2: Revert Specific Batches
```bash
# Revert just Technical Auditing batch (last)
git revert 19102e8 9f7c00d

# Revert Security & Compliance batch
git revert af0b012 0f57d27

# ... etc for other batches
```

### Option 3: Fix Forward (Preferred)
If issues are minor (typos, incorrect links, etc.), fix forward:
```bash
# Make corrections
git add src/data/helpContent.js
git commit -m "fix: Correct [specific issue] in help content"
git push
```

The environment variable name 'VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY' is exposed in the UI, which reveals implementation details. Additionally, there is no mechanism for administrators or users to select between different Claude model tiers (e.g., Haiku for faster/cheaper suggestions vs. Sonnet for higher quality) based on their use case.",

    "LEGITIMATELY_SKIPPED": [
      {"bug_id": "R10-A-013", "reason": "LoginForm is intentionally minimal - it handles authentication only. Onboarding is handled by OnboardingWalkthrough component which displays after first login. Adding inline feedback or onboarding to the login form would add unnecessary complexity."},
      {"bug_id": "R07-A-016", "reason": "OnboardingWalkthrough describes tool features factually ('Get AI-assisted recommendations', 'Get AI-generated fix suggestions'). These are accurate feature descriptions, not AI-generated content claims. The descriptions also include appropriate qualifiers like 'suggestions require professional review'."},
      {"bug_id": "R11-A-006", "reason": "OnboardingWalkthrough is designed for one-time display on first login. localStorage flag hasCompletedOnboarding controls this. Users can replay from Help menu. Phase names are simplified for onboarding context."},
      {"bug_id": "R07-A-011", "reason": "FeatureDetailPage content is entirely static/hardcoded, not AI-generated. The feature descriptions now include appropriate disclaimers like 'Suggestions are advisory and require professional review' (line 99) and 'requires professional review' (line 135)."}

    "FEATURE_REQUEST": [
      {"bug_id": "R08-A-007", "reason": "File upload/deletion audit trail requires new infrastructure for tracking file operations with user, timestamp, and action metadata. Would need a Firestore subcollection or centralized audit log service, which is beyond the scope of the FileUpload component."},
      {"bug_id": "R08-C-014", "reason": "Detecting and cleaning up orphaned Storage files requires a background process or Cloud Function that cross-references Firestore records with Storage contents. This is an infrastructure feature, not a component fix."},
      {"bug_id": "R09-B-012", "reason": "Full LRU cache eviction with per-feature storage budgets requires significant rearchitecture of localStorage strategy. The current improved eviction (removing multiple expendable keys + readability cache on quota error) is a reasonable intermediate solution."},
      {"bug_id": "R09-C-013", "reason": "Analysis cache already has 24-hour TTL (CACHE_DURATION_MS), MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES limit of 20, and MAX_CACHE_ENTRY_SIZE of 512KB. The defect asks for additional size pre-checks which are now implemented. Remaining ask for invalidation on data model changes would require event system integration."}

    "DESIGN_DECISION": [],
    "INVALID": [
      {"bug_id": "R06-107", "evidence": "UserSettingsPage heading hierarchy IS correct: h1 'Settings' (line 309), h2 for each section including 'Danger Zone' (line 745), and h3 'Delete Account' (line 754). The h1 > h2 > h3 progression follows proper semantic hierarchy. The defect incorrectly claimed this was wrong."},
      {"bug_id": "R11-B-014", "evidence": "GlossaryPage relatedTerms work correctly. Lines 187-188 use case-insensitive matching: glossaryTerms.find(t => t.term.toLowerCase() === related.toLowerCase()). When a match is found, lines 192-199 set the selected term and scroll to it. The defect's concern about string mismatch is not valid given the current implementation."}

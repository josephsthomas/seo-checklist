      {"bug_id": "R02-016", "evidence": "PageLoader gradient at line 95 now has dark mode variants (dark:from-charcoal-900 dark:to-charcoal-800). The defect referenced App.jsx line 94 which is the PageLoader component"},

      {"bug_id": "R09-A-011", "evidence": "All seven public pages (lines 25-31) now use lazyWithRetry() instead of eager imports, properly code-splitting public marketing pages"},
      {"bug_id": "R01-002", "evidence": "VPATReportGenerator line 98 now uses proper [showPreview, setShowPreview] without underscore prefix or eslint-disable. Preview button at line 430 has functional onClick handler"},
      {"bug_id": "R02-008", "evidence": "VPATReportGenerator line 315 now uses responsive grid 'grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-5' instead of fixed grid-cols-5"},

    "FIXED_NOW": [
      {"bug_id": "R02-001", "evidence": "Fixed inconsistent indentation in App.jsx main content area. The <main> tag, <ErrorBoundary>, <Suspense>, <Routes>, and all child Route elements now use consistent 2-space indentation increments. The </main> closing tag, <Footer>, <Toaster>, <FeedbackWidget>, and <CookieConsent> siblings are all at the correct 6-space indent level matching the <main> opening tag"},
      {"bug_id": "R02-117", "evidence": "Fixed dynamic Tailwind class construction in ScheduleFormModal. Added borderClass, selectedBgClass, and selectedTextClass properties to each REPORT_TYPES entry. Updated the form modal button rendering (lines 806-844) to use these static class properties instead of template literals like border-${type.color}-500, ensuring Tailwind JIT compiler can detect all class names"},
      {"bug_id": "R07-B-016", "evidence": "Added AI disclaimer rendering in ScheduleFormModal Step 1 (after report type selection grid). When a report type with aiDisclaimer property is selected (currently image-audit), an amber warning box with AlertTriangle icon displays the disclaimer text. Also added AlertTriangle to lucide-react imports"}

    "LEGITIMATELY_SKIPPED": [
      {"bug_id": "R02-020", "reason": "react-hot-toast library requires inline style objects for toastOptions.style configuration. The library API does not support Tailwind utility classes for toast styling. The className property is set but core visual properties (background, color, borderRadius, padding, boxShadow, fontSize, fontWeight) must be inline CSS. This is a genuine library constraint that cannot be worked around without forking the library."}

    "DESIGN_DECISION": [
      {"bug_id": "R04-001", "reason": "The /audit/shared/:shareId route intentionally sits outside the /app prefix because it is a public sharing route that does not require authentication (no <ProtectedRoute> wrapper). Moving it under /app would either break public access or require special auth handling. The comment on line 281 confirms this is intentional: 'keeps old path for sharing'. The readability share route similarly uses a non-/app path (/shared/readability/:shareToken). Changing would break existing shared links."},
      {"bug_id": "R04-002", "reason": "The /accessibility (public legal page) and /app/accessibility (authenticated audit tool) use the same path segment but are clearly distinguished by the /app prefix namespace. This is standard practice in web applications where public informational pages and authenticated tools may share domain concepts. The /app prefix unambiguously separates the two contexts for developers and users alike."},
      {"bug_id": "R04-003", "reason": "The route /app/planner/projects/:projectId renders SEOChecklist with toolName 'Content Checklist'. This reflects the product's evolution where the SEO Checklist component was rebranded as 'Content Checklist' in the user-facing UI while retaining its code-level component name. The toolName in the error boundary is the user-facing label. Renaming the component would be a larger refactor with no functional benefit."}
    ],
    "FEATURE_REQUEST": [
      {"bug_id": "R06-008", "reason": "Creating a sitemap.xml for a React SPA requires build-time generation infrastructure (e.g., a build script that reads route config and outputs sitemap.xml to the public directory). This is not a bug in existing code but a missing SEO feature that requires new build tooling, potentially a plugin like vite-plugin-sitemap or a custom build step. The routes are all client-side rendered, so a static sitemap would need to be generated and maintained separately."},
      {"bug_id": "R08-B-003", "reason": "The ScheduledReportsPanel stores all data in local React state with a TODO comment confirming Firestore persistence is not yet implemented. This requires: (1) Firestore collection schema design, (2) CRUD operations with Firebase SDK, (3) Real-time sync with onSnapshot listeners, (4) User-scoped data isolation. This is a significant backend integration feature, not a simple UI fix. The component currently functions as a UI prototype."},
      {"bug_id": "R11-B-008", "reason": "Same underlying issue as R08-B-003 - scheduled report configurations are lost on component unmount because they exist only in local React state. Implementing Firestore persistence requires the same backend integration work described for R08-B-003. This is a feature request for data persistence infrastructure, not a bug in existing code logic."}

        <h2>Introduction to AI Content Optimization</h2>
        <p>Content optimization for AI search engines is a growing field. Modern AI models extract information from web pages to answer user questions. This guide covers the key strategies you need to know.</p>
        <p>Good content structure helps AI models understand your page. Clear headings, short paragraphs, and semantic HTML all contribute to better AI readability scores.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Content Structure Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Your content structure is the foundation of AI readability. A well-organized page helps both human readers and AI models find information quickly.</p>

        <h3>Heading Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>Use a single H1 tag for your main title. Follow it with H2 tags for major sections. Use H3 tags for subsections within each H2. Never skip heading levels.</p>

        <h3>Semantic HTML Elements</h3>
        <p>Use semantic elements like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>. These elements help AI models understand the purpose of each content block.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> for the main content</li>
          <li>Use <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> for navigation menus</li>
          <li>Use <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> for thematic groupings</li>
          <li>Use <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> for related but secondary content</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Paragraph Length</h3>
        <p>Keep paragraphs short. Aim for three to five sentences per paragraph. This improves readability for both humans and AI models.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Writing for Clarity</h2>
        <p>Clear writing is essential for AI readability. AI models perform best with simple, direct language.</p>

        <h3>Sentence Length</h3>
        <p>Keep sentences under 25 words on average. Mix short and long sentences for natural flow. Break complex ideas into multiple sentences.</p>

        <h3>Active Voice</h3>
        <p>Use active voice whenever possible. Active voice is clearer and more direct. For example, write "The team completed the project" instead of "The project was completed by the team."</p>

        <h3>Avoid Jargon</h3>
        <p>Use plain language that your audience understands. Define technical terms when you first use them. Avoid unnecessary acronyms and abbreviations.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Technical Optimization</h2>
        <p>Technical factors affect how well AI models can access your content. Proper configuration ensures your pages are crawlable and indexable.</p>

        <h3>AI Crawler Access</h3>
        <p>Ensure your robots.txt file allows AI crawlers. Common AI crawlers include GPTBot, ClaudeBot, and Google-Extended. Allow access to maximize AI visibility.</p>

        <h3>Page Performance</h3>
        <p>Fast-loading pages are more likely to be crawled completely. Optimize images, minimize JavaScript, and use content delivery networks for better performance.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Structured Data Implementation</h2>
        <p>Structured data helps AI models understand your content at a deeper level. JSON-LD is the preferred format for implementing structured data.</p>

        <h3>Essential Schema Types</h3>
        <p>Implement Article schema for blog posts and guides. Add FAQPage schema for frequently asked questions. Use BreadcrumbList for navigation context. Include Organization schema for your business identity.</p>

        <h3>Best Practices for Schema</h3>
        <p>Always validate your structured data. Use Google's Rich Results Test to check for errors. Keep your schema up to date with your content changes.</p>
      </section>

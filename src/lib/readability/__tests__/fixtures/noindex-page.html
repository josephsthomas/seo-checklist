      <h1>Internal Dashboard</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This internal dashboard contains sensitive metrics and data that should not appear in search engine results. The noindex directive ensures crawlers will not add this page to their index.</p>
        <p>Pages marked with noindex can still be crawled but will not be shown in search results. This is different from blocking access entirely via robots.txt.</p>
